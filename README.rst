Remote Amarok
=============

Remote Amarok is a kind of remote control for Amarok.
It's built on Python using the Twisted framework, it is also my first
Twisted project. I hope to improve it as much as the time give me the
possibility.

Use: git clone http://github.com/mguillech/remote-amarok.git

to download the sources.

Run with `run_server.sh` the server on one machine (the one that has Amarok
up and running), and `client.py SERVER` to connect to that machine.

Hope you enjoy it!
